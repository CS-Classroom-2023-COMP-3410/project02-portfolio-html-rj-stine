Overall I think this was an okay project and I actually had fun working on it. I did struggle at first with where to get started but I knew right away I 
wanted some sort of sidebar directory so that I could easily navigate my website. Since I didn't really know how to do this I turned to ChatGPT in order to get started.
I be honest, I turned to it often or at least only when I was stuck and wasn't sure how to do something or only after I tried mutiple times to fix a problem myself. 
Realistically I only used it for small problems or fixes and once I started to understand the structure of creating the website more I was able to do thinkg on my own
for pretty much the rest of the project. Some of it I did find simple but HTML is simple in its own way I think but I also struggled slightly. I am unsure if everything is
entirely HTML though. I tried my  best to use the notes to fifgure out what was eight or wrong and it appears I did eveything in HTML but maybe slightly different than
the notes. Overall I feel good about this though.
